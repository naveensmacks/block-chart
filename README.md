# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# block-chart

Use a lookback of 10 blocks for all three charts so the chart isn’t empty when the page loads.

The first chart is to monitor the logs of an arbitrary ERC20 token address you provide.

For each block that passes, plot the total volume of the transfers (if any). Test this on more popular ERC20 tokens.

The second chart is the BASEFEE of each block. So the X-axis is the block number, and the Y-axis is the BASEFEE. If you aren’t sure what that is, watch the Gas Savings EIP 1559 video.

The third chart is the ratio of gasUsed over gasLimit (plot this as a percentage). 
What do you notice about the relationship between this ratio and the BASEFEE?
-Current block's BaseFee increase/decrease based on the previous block's gas utilization rate. i.e, if previous block's gas utilization rate increase to +10% then the next block's BaseFee may increase and viceversa.
